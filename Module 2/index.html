                <p>
                    Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and
					low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have
					become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has 
					been variously adapted to regional tastes.

                <p>
                    Meat is animal flesh that is eaten as food. Humans have hunted and killed animals for meat
					since prehistoric times. The advent of civilization allowed the domestication of animals 
					such as chickens, sheep, rabbits, pigs and cattle. This eventually led to their use in meat
					production on an industrial scale with the aid of slaughterhouses.

                <h2>Sushi</h2>
                <p>
                    Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown
					rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail,
					salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with
					pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular
					garnishes for the dish.
